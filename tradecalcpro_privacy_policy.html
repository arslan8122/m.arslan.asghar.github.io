    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <p>
      TradeCalc Pro ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed
      to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled
      when you use the TradeCalc Pro mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      TradeCalc Pro is designed to work fully offline. Most data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.
    </p>

    <p>The app stores the following information <strong>locally on your device</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Saved projects and calculations</li>
      <li>User preferences (such as theme settings)</li>
      <li>Notes entered by the user</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      All stored data remains on your device and is not shared with us or any
      third party, except as described in the Third-Party Services section below.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not require you to create an account, sign in, or provide any personal
      information such as name, email address, phone number, or location.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if you choose to purchase a subscription through Google Play Store or Apple App Store,
      your payment information is processed by the respective store (Google or Apple) according to their privacy policies.
      We do not have access to your payment information.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      TradeCalc Pro uses Google AdMob to display advertisements in the free version of the app.
      AdMob is a third-party advertising service provided by Google LLC.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>How AdMob Works:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>AdMob may collect certain information to provide personalized ads, including device identifiers, IP addresses, and usage data</li>
      <li>This information is collected by Google AdMob, not by TradeCalc Pro</li>
      <li>AdMob's collection and use of data is governed by Google's Privacy Policy</li>
      <li>You can opt-out of personalized ads through your device settings (iOS) or Google account settings (Android)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Subscription Users:</strong> If you have an active subscription (Pro version), ads are completely disabled and no advertising data is collected.
    </p>

    <p>
      For more information about how Google uses data when you use our app, please visit:
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      TradeCalc Pro may request limited device permissions solely to provide core
      functionality, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>File access (to export or share PDFs)</li>
      <li>Local storage access (to save projects and calculations)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These permissions are used only within the app and never for data collection
      or tracking beyond what is necessary for app functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      TradeCalc Pro uses the following third-party services:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Google AdMob</strong> - For displaying advertisements in the free version of the app.
        AdMob's data collection and use is governed by Google's Privacy Policy.
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Play Billing / Apple App Store</strong> - For processing subscription purchases.
        Payment information is handled by Google or Apple according to their respective privacy policies.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These services have their own privacy policies governing the collection and use of your information.
      We encourage you to review their privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since most data is stored locally on your device, you are in full control of
      your information. Removing the app will permanently delete all locally
      stored data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any data transmitted to third-party services (such as AdMob or app stores) is
      subject to their respective security practices and privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      TradeCalc Pro is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not
      knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you are a parent
      or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information,
      please contact us so we can delete such information.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Opting Out of Personalized Ads:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Android:</strong> You can opt-out through your Google account settings or device settings</li>
      <li><strong>iOS:</strong> You can opt-out through your device settings (Settings > Privacy > Apple Advertising)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Subscription:</strong> Purchasing a Pro subscription removes all advertisements and associated data collection.

    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      reflected on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to
